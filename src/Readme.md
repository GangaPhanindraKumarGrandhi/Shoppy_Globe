Backend Part

1. Start the Backend Server
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
This will start the API at:http://localhost:5000

2. Register a New User
POST http://localhost:5000/register
JSON Body:
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "password": "123456"
}
 Sample Success Response: 
  {
  "_id": "665f123abc...",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "password": "123456"
  }

3. Login User
POST http://localhost:5000/login
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
 Sample Success Response:

 {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1..."
 }

 After logging in or registering, copy the token from the response:

 4. Add This Header in All Protected Requests
Key: Authorization 
Vlaue:JWT <your_token>

Note:
Without This Header
If you try to access protected routes (like /cart, /checkout, etc.) without the token, you'll get:
{
  "message": "Not authorized, token failed"
}

5. MongoDB Connection (config/db.js)Edit this file
This file is used to connect your backend to your local MongoDB server using Mongoose.
Uses mongoose.connect() to connect to:
mongodb://localhost:27017/shoppyglobe

6. Import All Products("https://dummyjson.com/products")
The importAllProducts script fetches product data from the internet and stores it into the products database.
command:node importAllProducts.js

7. Delete All Products
The deleteAllProducts file is used to delete all existing products from the products database.
command:node deleteAllProducts.js

//Note:
  To import or delete products and store them into your MongoDB database, your importAllProducts script must connect to MongoDB first.

Frontend Part
